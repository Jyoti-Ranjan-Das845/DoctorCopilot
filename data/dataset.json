        "content":"Diagnostic Tests for Diabetes: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of continuous glucose monitoring for screening or diagnosing prediabetes or diabetes. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crisis), diagnosis of type 2 diabetes requires confirmatory testing, which can be a different test on the same day or the same test on a different day. Marked discordance between A1C and repeated blood glucose measurements should raise the possibility of a problem or interference with either test. Classification: Classification of diabetes type is not always straightforward at presentation, and misdiagnosis is common. Section 2: Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM; detected at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals without previously identified diabetes or high-risk glucose metabolism), Diabetes from other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes), Type 2 diabetes (non-autoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome), Type 1 diabetes (idiopathic or autoimmune β-cell destruction). Fasting plasma glucose: Prediabetes: 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), Diabetes: ≥126 mg/dL (≥7.0 mmol/L). Random glucose value with classic hyperglycemia symptoms/hyperglycemic crisis: Diabetes: ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L). 2-hour glucose value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test: Prediabetes: 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), Diabetes: ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L). Diagnostic criteria: A1C: Prediabetes: 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol), Diabetes: ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol). Suggested citation: American Diabetes Association Primary Care Advisory Group. 2.

Informal Risk Factor Assessment for Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes: Clinical Notes: If results are normal, repeat screening at least every 3 years (annually for those with prediabetes), or sooner with symptoms or changes in risk. Risk-based screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier, in children and adolescents with overweight (BMI ≥85th percentile) or obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) who have one or more risk factors for diabetes. Adults (≥18 years of age) with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2 or ≥23 kg/m2 in Asian American individuals) who have one or more of the following risk factors: First-degree relative with diabetes, High-risk race/ethnicity, History of cardiovascular disease, Hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension), Polycystic ovary syndrome, HDL cholesterol <35 mg/dL (<0.9 mmol/L) and/or triglycerides >250 mg/dL (>2.8 mmol/L), Physical inactivity, Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, People with HIV, exposure to high-risk medicines, or a history of pancreatitis. Everyone ≥35 years of age, History of prediabetes, People with prior GDM.Additional Screening Guidelines: Condition Clinical Tips Best Test: An altered relationship between A1C and glycemia. A mismatch between A1C and glycemia could be caused by some hemoglobin variants, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, anemia, or erythropoietin therapy. People with HIV should be screened for diabetes and prediabetes before and 3–6 months after starting or changing antiretroviral therapy, and annually if initial results are normal. Fasting plasma glucose. Acute pancreatitis: Screen for diabetes 3-6 months after an episode of acute pancreatitis and annually thereafter. Any standard test for diagnosing diabetes. Cystic fibrosis: Annual screening should begin by the age of 10 years in all people with cystic fibrosis not previously diagnosed with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance test. Posttransplantation status: Screen for hyperglycemia after organ transplantation. Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus should be diagnosed when the individual is stable on immunosuppressive therapy and free of acute infections. Oral glucose tolerance test. Possible monogenic diabetes: Suspect monogenic diabetes in people diagnosed with diabetes in the first 6 months of life and in children and young adults with atypical characteristics of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who often have a family history of diabetes in successive generations (suggestive of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance). Any standard test for diagnosing diabetes plus appropriate genetic testing. Therapy with certain medications: Consider screening people for prediabetes or diabetes if they are on certain medications known to increase diabetes risk, such as glucocorticoids, statins, thiazide diuretics, some HIV medications, and second-generation antipsychotic medications. Any standard test for diagnosing diabetes.",
        "summary":"Diabetes diagnosis requires confirmatory tests in the absence of clear hyperglycemia, with potential discrepancies between A1C and blood glucose measurements suggesting testing issues. Diabetes classification can be complex, with types including Type 1 (autoimmune), Type 2 (insulin resistance), gestational, and others stemming from genetic syndromes or external factors. Screening for diabetes and prediabetes in asymptomatic adults should consider risk factors, with specific guidelines for children, adolescents, and high-risk groups like those with cardiovascular history or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome. Special considerations are necessary for conditions like hemoglobin variants, HIV, or post-transplant status that could alter test results. Standard tests include fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance tests, and A1C, with additional genetic tests for suspected monogenic diabetes. Regular screenings are advised post-acute conditions like pancreatitis and post-transplant, and in scenarios of potential drug-induced diabetes risks."

        "content":"The document titled Prevention or Delay of Diabetes abridged from DIABETESJOURNALS.ORG/CLINICAL provides comprehensive guidance on screening for Type 2 Diabetes and associated care strategies. It begins with diet and physical activity recommendations for adults at risk, emphasizing whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits, and vegetables while minimizing refined and processed foods. Healthy eating patterns suggested include Mediterranean-style, low-carbohydrate, vegetarian or plant-based, and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). Physical activity recommendations include at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity, such as brisk walking, potentially including resistance or strength training, and breaking up prolonged sedentary time. The document outlines a three-step approach to screening: why, how, and when. Lab testing is described as safe and cost-effective, providing an opportunity to address cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Screening methods include informal risk factor assessment or using tools like the ADA risk test, with diagnostic testing based on results. Monitoring frequency is advised as at least annually for those with prediabetes, and at least every 3 years for those without prediabetes and normal results. For children and adolescents with overweight (BMI ≥85th percentile) or obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) and at least one risk factor, screening is recommended after puberty onset or age 10. The document then presents person-centered care goals, emphasizing individualized risk-benefit analysis of interventions, focusing on weight management, minimizing hyperglycemia progression, and reducing cardiovascular risk. More intensive approaches are suggested for high-risk individuals with BMI ≥35 kg/m², higher glucose levels (fasting plasma glucose 110-125 mg/dL [6.1-6.9 mmol/L], 2-h post-challenge glucose 173-199 mg/dL [9.6-11 mmol/L], and A1C ≥6.0% [42 mmol/mol]), or a history of gestational diabetes mellitus. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study is highlighted, showing that intensive lifestyle intervention could reduce type 2 diabetes risk by 58% over 3 years, with goals of ≥7% weight loss and ≥150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. Technology-assisted programs using smartphones, web apps, and telehealth platforms are noted as effective in delivering the DPP lifestyle change program, especially for low-income and rural individuals. Regarding medication, while the FDA hasn't approved any drugs specifically for diabetes prevention, metformin is cited as having the strongest evidence base. Metformin therapy is suggested for adults aged 25-59 years with BMI ≥35 kg/m², those with higher fasting plasma glucose (≥110 mg/dL [≥6 mmol/L]) or A1C (≥6.0% [≥42 mmol/mol]), and individuals with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus. For those on metformin, periodic vitamin B12 measurement is advised, especially in cases of anemia or peripheral neuropathy. The document also covers type 1 diabetes screening using autoantibodies and disease progression monitoring, recommending A1C testing approximately every 6 months and annual 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests (fasting and 2-h plasma glucose). Teplizumab-mzwv infusion is mentioned as a potential treatment to delay symptomatic onset in individuals ≥8 years of age with stage 2 type 1 diabetes. The document addresses whether statin therapy increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, noting that statin therapy may slightly elevate type 2 diabetes risk in high-risk individuals, but in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, statin benefits outweigh diabetes risk. It advises against discontinuing statins based on concerns about increased diabetes risk. Regarding pioglitazone's role in secondary cardiovascular prevention for people at risk of type 2 diabetes, the document states that pioglitazone could reduce stroke and myocardial infarction risks in people with a history of stroke and evidence of insulin resistance or prediabetes. However, it cautions that the benefit must be weighed against potential weight gain, edema, and increased fracture risk, suggesting that lower doses may lessen these adverse effects. Finally, a table on type 1 diabetes staging is presented, detailing characteristics and diagnostic criteria for stages 1, 2, and 3. Stage 1 is characterized by autoimmunity, normoglycemia, and multiple islet autoantibodies without impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Stage 2 involves autoimmunity, dysglycemia, with multiple islet autoantibodies, IFG and/or IGT, fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L), 2-hour plasma glucose 140-199 mg/dL (7.8-11.0 mmol/L), and A1C 5.7-6.4% (39-47 mmol/mol) or ≥10% increase. Stage 3 is marked by overt hyperglycemia, symptoms, possible absence of autoantibodies, and diabetes by standard criteria. The document also notes alternative stage 2 diagnostic criteria used in clinical trials, involving 30-, 60-, or 90-minute plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) with confirmatory testing in those aged ≥18 years.The document addresses the question of whether statin therapy increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It notes that statin therapy may slightly elevate type 2 diabetes risk in high-risk individuals. However, in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the benefits of statin therapy outweigh the diabetes risk. The document advises against discontinuing statins based on concerns about increased diabetes risk. Regarding the role of pioglitazone in secondary cardiovascular prevention for people at risk of type 2 diabetes, the document states that pioglitazone could reduce stroke and myocardial infarction risks in people with a history of stroke and evidence of insulin resistance or prediabetes. However, it cautions that the benefit must be weighed against potential side effects such as weight gain, edema, and increased fracture risk. The document suggests that lower doses of pioglitazone may help lessen these adverse effects.",

        "content":"Diabetes treatment goals aim to prevent or delay complications and optimize the quality of life. These goals should be developed collaboratively with people with diabetes to honor their preferences and values. Comprehensive diabetes care should be provided by an interprofessional team which may include but is not limited to diabetes care and education specialists, primary care and subspecialty clinicians, nurses, registered dietitian nutritionists, exercise specialists, pharmacists, dentists, podiatrists, behavioral health professionals, and community partners such as community health workers and community paramedics. Ongoing treatment necessitates regular follow-up and the active engagement of people with diabetes and their care partners. Comprehensive medical evaluations and the provision of all recommended vaccinations (cdc.gov/vaccines) are essential components of ongoing diabetes care. People with type 1 diabetes should be screened soon after diagnosis and periodically thereafter for autoimmune thyroid disease and other autoimmune conditions if suggestive signs and symptoms are present. Autoimmune conditions associated with type 1 diabetes include autoimmune thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, primary adrenal insufficiency, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, autoimmune liver disease, and collagen vascular diseases. People with type 1 or type 2 diabetes have a higher fracture risk than those without diabetes. This risk escalates with longer diabetes duration and poor glycemic control. People with type 2 diabetes on thiazolidinediones, insulin, or a sulfonylurea have an even higher fracture risk. In older adults (>65 years of age) and high-risk young adults, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry every 2–3 years is recommended. Counseling on calcium and vitamin D, aerobic and weight-bearing physical activity, and fall precautions is important. Choosing glucose-lowering medications with safe profiles for bone health and low hypoglycemia risk to prevent falls is essential. Antiresorptive and osteoanabolic agents should be considered for those with a T-score ≤−2.0 or previous fragility fractures. Diabetes is associated with increased risk of cancers of the liver, pancreas, endometrium, colon/rectum, breast, and bladder. Nevertheless, cancer screening recommendations are the same for people with diabetes as for those without diabetes. Approximately 70% of people with type 2 diabetes have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Screening goals include identifying individuals at risk for complications from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and preventing death from liver disease. High-risk individuals include those with central obesity and cardiometabolic risks or insulin resistance, individuals >50 years of age, and those with persistent high plasma aminotransferase levels (AST/ALT >30 units/L for >6 months). The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index score, based on age, ALT and AST levels, and platelet count, should be calculated for screening. Weight loss with intensive lifestyle therapy and/or metabolic surgery, as appropriate, is recommended. Pioglitazone and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists are the preferred agents for treating hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and NASH, unless decompensated cirrhosis is present. People with type 2 diabetes and decompensated cirrhosis from NASH should be treated with insulin. Statin therapy is safe in the setting of NAFLD, but should be used with caution and close monitoring in people with decompensated cirrhosis. At the initial visit for a comprehensive diabetes medical evaluation, past medical and family history should be reviewed, including the characteristics at onset, previous treatment plans, and frequency/cause/severity of past hospitalizations. Family history of diabetes in a first-degree relative and autoimmune disorder should be assessed. A personal history of complications and common comorbidities, such as obesity, OSA, NAFLD, high blood pressure, or abnormal lipids, should be documented. Macrovascular and microvascular complications, hypoglycemia awareness/frequency/causes/timing of episodes, presence of hemoglobinopathies or anemias, last dental visit, last dilated eye exam, visits to specialists, and disability assessment and use of assistive devices should be considered. Changes in medical/family history since the last visit should be recorded. Behavioral factors, such as eating patterns, weight history, familiarity with carbohydrate counting, physical activity, sleep behaviors, tobacco, alcohol, and substance use, should be evaluated. The current medication plan, medication-taking behavior, medication intolerance or side effects, use of complementary and alternative medicine, and vaccination history and needs should be reviewed. Technology use, including health apps, online education, patient portals, glucose monitoring results and data use, insulin pump settings and use, and connected pen and glucose data, should be assessed. Social life assessment should include identifying existing social supports, surrogate decision maker, advanced care plan, and social determinants of health, such as food security, housing stability, transportation access, financial security, and community safety. Daily routine and environment, including school/work schedules and the ability to engage in diabetes self-management, should be considered. Physical examination should include height, weight, and BMI; growth/pubertal development in children and adolescents; blood pressure determination; orthostatic blood pressure measures (when indicated); fundoscopic examination (refer to eye specialist); thyroid palpation; skin examination; comprehensive foot examination; screening for PAD; determination of temperature, vibration or pinprick sensation, and 10-g monofilament exam; screening for depression, anxiety, diabetes distress, fear of hypoglycemia, and disordered eating; assessment for cognitive performance; assessment for functional performance; and assessment for bone pain. Laboratory evaluation should include A1C if results are not available within the past 3 months, lipid profile, liver function tests, spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, thyroid-stimulating hormone in people with type 1 diabetes, vitamin B12 if on metformin, complete blood count with platelets, serum potassium levels in people with diabetes on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics, and calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus for appropriate patients. ABI, ankle-brachial pressure index; ARBs, angiotensin receptor blockers; CGM, continuous glucose monitors; MDI, multiple daily injections; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; OSA, obstructive sleep apnea; PAD, peripheral arterial disease. At 65 years of age or older, more frequent assessments may be needed for people with known chronic kidney disease or with changes in medications that affect kidney function and serum potassium. Some laboratory values may need to be checked after the initiation or dose changes of medications that affect these values.",

        "content":"Section 6: Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia discusses the assessment of glycemic status, highlighting A1C measurement and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using appropriate metrics such as time in range (TIR) and glucose management indicator (GMI). Limitations of A1C measurement include its inaccuracy in conditions affecting red blood cell turnover, such as hemolytic and other anemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, recent blood transfusion, use of drugs that stimulate erythropoiesis, end-stage kidney disease, and pregnancy. Some hemoglobin variants can interfere with some A1C assays, although this problem has been minimized with newer assays. A1C does not assess glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. Consider alternative measures like fructosamine and glycated albumin when necessary. Assess glycemic variability using a combination of results from blood glucose monitoring/CGM and A1C. For those meeting treatment goals, A1C should be assessed at least two times per year. For individuals not meeting treatment goals, with frequent or severe hypo- or hyperglycemia, changing health status, or growth and development in youth, A1C should be assessed at least quarterly or more frequently as appropriate clinically. Clinical notes indicate the accuracy of A1C can be affected by conditions that affect red blood cell turnover, and alternative measures should be considered when necessary. Glucose assessment via CGM involves ensuring sufficient data for analysis, with CGM active at least 70% of the time over 14 days being recommended. It is important to discuss individuals’ daily self-management routines, ask them to identify and explain what they observe on the CGM report, and check overall CGM metrics. Key metrics include time below range (TBR) for glucose readings and time with glucose below 70 mg/dL, TIR for glucose readings and time between 70-180 mg/dL, time above range (TAR) for glucose readings and time above 250 mg/dL, mean glucose, GMI as an estimate of A1C, and glycemic variability expressed as percent coefficient of variation with a target of 36% or less. Identifying hypoglycemia first, then looking for hyperglycemia patterns, and reviewing the time spent in these patterns on the overall profile and daily graphs are essential steps. Discussing identified patterns and reflecting on potential causes and possible solutions with individuals is crucial. Using CGM metrics to assess glycemia and setting glycemic goals based on general guidelines for nonpregnant adults or those with frailty are important. Developing an action plan through shared decision-making is recommended. A calculator for converting A1C results into estimated average glucose (eAG) is available at professional.diabetes.org/eAG. Data from Nathan DM, Kuenen J, Borg R, Zheng H, Schoenfeld D; A1c-Derived Average Glucose Study Group show the correlation between A1C and eAG values. For example, an A1C of 5% corresponds to an eAG of 97 mg/dL (5.4 mmol/L), an A1C of 6% corresponds to 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), an A1C of 7% corresponds to 154 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L), and so on up to an A1C of 12% corresponding to 298 mg/dL (16.5 mmol/L). Glycemic goals should be individualized based on key characteristics of the person with diabetes, shared decision-making to address needs and preferences, and periodic reevaluation. General guidelines for many nonpregnant adults with diabetes without significant hypoglycemia include an A1C below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), preprandial capillary plasma glucose of 80-130 mg/dL (4.4-7.2 mmol/L), peak postprandial capillary plasma glucose below 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L), and CGM metrics with TIR above 70% and TBR below 4% and less than 1% of time with glucose below 54 mg/dL. A lower A1C goal may be beneficial if achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment, while a higher A1C goal (such as below 8% or 64 mmol/mol) may be appropriate for individuals with limited life expectancy or when the harms of treatment outweigh the benefits. For those with frailty or high risk of hypoglycemia, TIR above 50% with less than 1% TBR is appropriate. Deintensifying glucose-lowering medications is recommended for those at high risk of hypoglycemia or when treatment risks or burdens outweigh benefits. Person and disease factors used to determine optimal glycemic targets include risks potentially associated with hypoglycemia and other drug-related adverse effects, disease duration, life expectancy, important comorbidities, established vascular complications, individual needs and preferences, and resources and support systems. Hypoglycemia is categorized into three levels based on blood glucose concentrations and symptom severity: Level 1 is glucose below 70 mg/dL but at least 54 mg/dL, Level 2 is glucose below 54 mg/dL, and Level 3 is a severe event characterized by altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance for treatment of hypoglycemia, irrespective of glucose level. Assessment and medication selection involve reviewing hypoglycemia history at every clinical encounter in all at-risk individuals, screening for impaired hypoglycemia awareness, and considering hypoglycemia risk when selecting diabetes medications and setting glycemic goals. Prevention and management of hypoglycemia include using CGM for high-risk individuals, treating hypoglycemia with glucose or any form of fast-acting carbohydrate, retesting and retreating if needed after 15 minutes, ensuring glucagon is prescribed and education provided on its use and storage, offering structured education on hypoglycemia prevention and treatment, promptly reevaluating the treatment plan upon episodes of Level 2 or Level 3 hypoglycemia, referring individuals with impaired hypoglycemia awareness to trained health care professionals for evidence-based interventions, and conducting ongoing assessments of cognitive function to ensure extra caution and support for hypoglycemia if cognitive impairment or decline is identified. The approach to individualization of glycemic targets is influenced by patient and disease features, with more stringent targets for those with lower risks of hypoglycemia, newly diagnosed disease, long life expectancy, absence of important comorbidities or vascular complications, high motivation, excellent self-care capabilities, and readily available resources and support systems.

It recommends consulting with a specialized diabetes or glucose management team when possible. Hospital care delivery standards include instituting validated order sets for managing dysglycemia in the hospital, stating the type of diabetes on the initial evaluation when it is known, performing an A1C test on all hospitalized people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (random blood glucose >140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L]) if no A1C result is available from the prior 3 months, and assessing diabetes self-management knowledge and behaviors on admission, providing self-management education when needed. For perioperative care, the A1C goal for elective surgery is less than 8% (63.9 mmol/L) and the blood glucose goal within 4 hours of surgery is 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L). Medication adjustments include holding metformin on the day of surgery, discontinuing sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors 3–4 days before surgery, and holding other oral glucose-lowering agents the morning of the surgery or procedure. Insulin therapy adjustments involve giving half of the NPH dose or 75–80% of long-acting analog insulin or adjusting insulin pump basal rates based on diabetes type and clinical judgment. Transition from the hospital to the ambulatory setting should include a tailored structured discharge plan for the individual with diabetes, providing diabetes self-management education before discharge, ensuring medication reconciliation and access, and arranging virtual or in-person follow-up visits post-discharge. A visit with the primary care clinician, endocrinologist, or diabetes specialist should be scheduled within 1 month of discharge, with earlier follow-up (1–2 weeks) if medications change or glucose targets are not met at discharge. Strategies to reduce readmissions include identifying people with ketosis-prone diabetes, treating individuals with an admission A1C greater than 9% (75 mmol/mol) with insulin, implementing a transitional care model, and proactively planning for care transitions, including scheduling home health visits and timely follow-up care.

        "content":"Section 8: Obesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes emphasizes a holistic approach to obesity management, including nutrition counseling, regular exercise, behavioral strategies, and diabetes self-management education. Weight management is crucial for people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, as it delays the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes, treats type 2 diabetes, improves glycemia, reduces the need for glucose-lowering medications, lowers cardiovascular risk factors, and reduces other obesity-related health risks. When addressing weight management, it is important to use person-centered, nonjudgmental language, calculate BMI, measure body fat distribution, and monitor obesity-related parameters annually. Person-centered treatment options based on BMI include intensive behavioral counseling, obesity pharmacotherapy, and metabolic surgery. For BMI ranges 25.0–26.9 (or 23.0–24.9 for Asian American individuals), 27.0–29.9 (or 25.0–27.4), and ≥30.0 (or ≥27.5), the recommendations are as follows: intensive behavioral counseling is recommended for all ranges, obesity pharmacotherapy for BMI ≥27.0, and metabolic surgery for BMI ≥30.0.Nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral therapy aim for ≥5% weight loss, with frequent counseling (≥16 sessions in 6 months) to achieve a 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit. Long-term weight maintenance programs offering monthly support, weekly body weight monitoring, self-monitoring strategies, and regular physical activity (200–300 min/week) are advised. Short-term, structured very-low-calorie diets (800–1,000 kcal/day) should be prescribed by trained practitioners in medical settings with close monitoring and counseling for long-term weight maintenance. Care plans should consider systemic, structural, and socioeconomic factors affecting nutrition patterns and food choices, such as food insecurity and access to healthful options.Weight loss efficacy of glucose-lowering medications varies, with semaglutide (injectable) and tirzepatide having very high efficacy, dulaglutide and liraglutide high efficacy, exenatide, lixisenatide, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors intermediate efficacy, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and metformin being neutral. When choosing glucose-lowering medications, consider the weight impact and avoid those causing weight gain if possible. Obesity pharmacotherapy should be considered for those with diabetes and overweight or obesity, continuing if effective (>5% weight loss after 3 months) and reconsidering if less effective or if significant safety/tolerability issues arise.The document lists several drugs approved for the treatment of obesity, including their common side effects, safety concerns, and considerations. Phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic for short-term treatment (12 weeks), can cause dry mouth, insomnia, dizziness, irritability, increased blood pressure, and elevated heart rate, and is contraindicated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Phentermine/topiramate ER, a combination for long-term treatment (52 weeks), may cause constipation, paresthesia, insomnia, nasopharyngitis, xerostomia, and increased blood pressure. Naltrexone/bupropion ER, another long-term treatment, has side effects like constipation, nausea, headache, xerostomia, insomnia, elevated heart rate, and blood pressure, and is contraindicated in people with unmanaged hypertension, seizure disorders, or chronic opioid therapy, and carries a black box warning for suicidal behavior/ideation in people under 24 with depression.Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, can cause gastrointestinal side effects, injection site reactions, elevated heart rate, and hypoglycemia. It has potential risks for pancreatitis, kidney injury, cholelithiasis, gallstone-related complications, and gastrointestinal disorders, with a black box warning for thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents. Semaglutide and tirzepatide, also glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, share similar side effects and risks, including gastrointestinal issues, pancreatitis, kidney injury, cholelithiasis, and a black box warning for thyroid C-cell tumors.Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, has gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and esophageal reflux, injection site reactions, elevated heart rate, and hypoglycemia. It carries risks for pancreatitis, kidney injury, cholelithiasis, and gastrointestinal disorders like severe constipation and small bowel obstruction. Patients should be monitored for the effects of oral medications with narrow therapeutic indexes (e.g., warfarin) or those whose efficacy depends on threshold concentration. Those using oral hormonal contraception should use or add a nonoral contraception method for 4 weeks after initiation and dose escalations. Tirzepatide also has a black box warning for the risk of thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents, with human relevance not determined.Weight loss efficacy of glucose-lowering medications varies, with semaglutide (injectable) and tirzepatide having very high efficacy, dulaglutide and liraglutide high efficacy, exenatide, lixisenatide, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors intermediate efficacy, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and metformin being neutral. When choosing glucose-lowering medications for individuals with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, consider the weight impact and avoid those causing weight gain if possible. Obesity pharmacotherapy should be considered for those with diabetes and overweight or obesity, alongside lifestyle changes. It is recommended to continue obesity pharmacotherapy if it is effective (greater than 5% weight loss after 3 months). If weight loss is less than 5% after 3 months or if significant safety or tolerability issues arise, consider changing or stopping the treatment.",
        "summary":"Section 8: Obesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes emphasizes a holistic approach, including nutrition counseling, regular exercise, behavioral strategies, and diabetes self-management education. Weight management is crucial for people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity as it delays progression from prediabetes, treats type 2 diabetes, improves glycemia, reduces the need for glucose-lowering medications, and lowers cardiovascular and other obesity-related health risks. It is important to use person-centered, nonjudgmental language, calculate BMI, measure body fat distribution, and monitor obesity-related parameters annually. Treatment options include intensive behavioral counseling for all BMI ranges, obesity pharmacotherapy for BMI ≥27.0, and metabolic surgery for BMI ≥30.0. Achieving and maintaining ≥5% weight loss through nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral therapy is recommended, with frequent counseling and long-term weight maintenance programs advised.

        "content":"Section 9: Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment. Ways to Address or Prevent Therapeutic Inertia for People With Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes include: Empower Patients by being a Barrier Buster: Schedule diabetes-only visits, set and track shared goals and time frames, integrate screening for social/emotional barriers and identify support, prescribe thoughtfully, refer to diabetes self-management education and support (DSMEs), and ensure patients know their care champion. Optimize Care and Treatment by Acting Now: Conduct practice-based screening for likely therapeutic inertia, make personalized diabetes care plans, implement a team-based approach to increase the frequency and quality of engagement, utilize A1C and glucose data to drive rapid-cycle treatment intensification, stratify follow-up based on A1C/glucose data and changes in therapy, and ensure all necessary measures are in place to optimize therapy support during, after, and between visits. Leverage Tools and Technology to Improve Decision-Making: Follow a diabetes treatment algorithm, create and use a patient registry, integrate decision support into the workflow, utilize technology to enhance communication with people with diabetes, and disseminate unblinded quality metrics. When to Use Injectable Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes: Which therapy should I start first? Treatment with a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist or a dual GLP-1 receptor agonist is preferred before insulin therapy due to its ability to achieve both weight management and glycemic goals. Some GLP-1 receptor agonists also provide cardiovascular benefit. When should I start insulin first? If there is evidence of catabolism (e.g., unexplained weight loss) or when A1C or blood glucose levels are >10% (>86 mmol/mol) or 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L). Can I use combination insulin and non insulin injectable therapy? Yes; combination therapy with insulin and a noninsulin injectable is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness and beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk. When would I use combination insulin and non insulin injectable therapy? Consider combination insulin and GLP-1 or dual GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy when individualized goals are not met using either one separately. When should I modify a patient’s injectable therapy? Intensify or deintensify therapy when an individual is not meeting treatment goals, including management of hyperglycemia and avoidance of hypoglycemia.

This is approached initially by confirming adherence to, and optimizing, lifestyle interventions while reviewing the glucose-lowering drug regimen, taking into account factors such as cost, potential side effects, risk of hypoglycemia, effects on weight, patient preferences, and comorbidities. Primary interventions include promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors and diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S). Based on clinical profiles, initial medication options include Metformin (unless contraindicated), GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly when there is a compelling need to minimize hypoglycemia and/or promote weight loss, followed by other options like DPP-4 inhibitors, TZDs, Sulfonylureas or Insulin depending on specific needs. Special considerations are given to secondary factors such as the presence of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD), Heart Failure (HF), or Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), where GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors are preferred for ASCVD due to their proven cardiovascular benefits, and SGLT2 inhibitors are primarily considered for CKD or HF. If HbA1c remains above target despite these measures, the treatment regimen is intensified by adding other classes of medications. This includes an ongoing assessment and management of cardiovascular risk factors. The treatment strategy is progressively intensified, leading to the use of injectable therapies such as Insulin or combination therapies that include newer agents like GLP-1 receptor agonists. The overarching strategy ensures a holistic approach to patient care, integrating continuous monitoring and adjustments based on patient response and emerging clinical evidence, aiming to manage both diabetes and associated comorbid conditions effectively.Clinicians treating people with insulin therapy are advised to undertake several crucial actions to optimize care. First, providing or referring patients for education about insulin injection techniques, timing, and strategies for solving common issues such as hypoglycemia, incorrect dosages, and dose adjustments is essential. It's important to ensure that individuals have all necessary supplies for injections, such as pen needles for insulin pens or appropriate syringes for insulin dose size or concentration, along with glucose monitoring devices. Clinicians should evaluate individuals with type 2 diabetes to ascertain if they are candidates for GLP-1 or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy. Additionally, evaluating all people on insulin therapy to determine if they could benefit from continuous glucose monitoring is recommended. Ensuring that those on insulin therapy have the necessary education and supplies to prevent and treat hypoglycemia, including glucagon, glucose monitoring supplies, and appropriate sources of carbohydrates to treat low glucose levels, is also vital. Finally, scheduling timely and routine follow-up visits is crucial to reassess patients and adjust care plans to avoid therapeutic inertia, ensuring ongoing effective management of diabetes through tailored, responsive care plans.",

        "content":"Section 15: Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy. Preconception Counseling: This subsection emphasizes the importance of integrating preconception counseling into diabetes care from puberty for all individuals with diabetes of childbearing potential. Key aspects include discussing family planning, prescribing effective contraception until A1C levels are optimized for pregnancy, focusing on achieving as normal glucose levels as safely possible (ideally A1C <6.5%), and addressing risks like congenital anomalies and preeclampsia. Nutritional guidance, diabetes education, and screening for diabetes-related comorbidities are highlighted. Special attention is given to the risk of diabetic retinopathy, recommending a dilated eye examination before pregnancy or during the first trimester, followed by continuous monitoring.Glycemic Management and Goals in Pregnancy:** Targets for glycemic control include fasting plasma glucose <95 mg/dL and postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL after 1 hour or <120 mg/dL after 2 hours. The ideal A1C goal is <6% if achievable without significant hypoglycemia, though it may be relaxed to <7% to prevent hypoglycemic episodes. Continuous glucose monitoring is advised alongside standard blood glucose monitoring to help achieve these goals.Management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM):** GDM is defined as diabetes diagnosed after the first trimester in individuals without prior diabetes. Screening for GDM is recommended between 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. Management focuses on lifestyle modifications, with insulin as the preferred treatment for hyperglycemia. Metformin and glyburide are not recommended as first-line agents due to a lack of long-term safety data.Additional Drug Considerations During Pregnancy:** Blood pressure management is critical, with medication initiation or titration starting at 140/90 mmHg and targeting 110–135/84 mmHg. Medications potentially harmful in pregnancy, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins, should be discontinued prior to conception and avoided without reliable contraception.Postpartum Care:** Includes a psychosocial assessment and support for self-care, along with discussing and implementing a contraception plan. Specific postpartum care for individuals with GDM involves screening for diabetes at 4–12 weeks postpartum using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Lifelong diabetes screening every 1–3 years is recommended, along with intensive lifestyle interventions and/or metformin therapy for those with overweight/obesity and prediabetes.Lactation:** Breastfeeding promotion is encouraged due to its benefits in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes later in life.Postpartum Care for Individuals With Preexisting Diabetes:** Post-delivery, a significant decrease in insulin resistance occurs. It is crucial to evaluate insulin requirements, adjust doses accordingly, and monitor for hypoglycemia.The document concludes with a reference to the complete ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes—2024, which provides detailed guidelines in Table 15.1, and cites the source of the abridged information for primary care professionals.

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR):Optimizing management of glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids can reduce or slow the progression of microvascular complications of diabetes, including DR. Screening is crucial for timely treatment to prevent or reverse vision loss. A dilated comprehensive eye exam is recommended for type 1 diabetes within 5 years of onset and for type 2 diabetes at diagnosis. The frequency of follow-up exams should be at least annually if any level of retinopathy is present, every 1-2 years if no retinopathy has been noted in one or more annual exams and glycemia is well-managed, and more frequently if retinopathy is progressing or sight-threatening. Retinal photography, with remote reading or the use of an authorized artificial intelligence tool, can expand access to screening where qualified eye care professionals are not available. Treatment involves prompt referral to an ophthalmologist experienced in managing DR for any level of diabetic macular edema, moderate or worse nonproliferative DR, or any proliferative DR.Neuropathy:Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) should start at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, with annual assessments thereafter. Symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy should also be assessed with the same frequency, especially if other microvascular complications like kidney disease and DPN are present. Treatment options for DPN include gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers. Referral to a neurologist or pain specialist is recommended when pain control exceeds the treating clinician’s scope of practice.Foot Care:Initial recommendations for foot care include daily inspection, use of moisturizers for dry skin, and avoidance of self-care for ingrown nails and calluses. Individuals with increased plantar pressures should use well-fitted athletic or walking shoes with customized pressure-relieving orthoses. Risk stratification and screening frequency are categorized by ulcer risk from very low to high, with examination frequencies ranging from annually to every 1-3 months, depending on the presence of loss of protective sensation (LOPS), peripheral artery disease (PAD), history of foot ulcer, amputation, or end-stage renal disease.This abridged version from the ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes—2024 for primary care professionals, details the recommended practices for managing retinopathy, neuropathy, and foot care in diabetic patients, aiming to prevent complications and manage existing conditions effectively. The document includes citations such as Schaper NC et al. from Diabetes Metab Res Rev 2020 for its guidelines on foot care, demonstrating an evidence-based approach tailored to the needs of the patient.**Risk Stratification and Screening Frequency for Foot Care in Diabetic Patients** delineates four categories of ulcer risk to guide the frequency of foot examinations. Category 0 (Very Low Risk) includes patients with no loss of protective sensation (LOPS) and no peripheral artery disease (PAD), requiring annual exams. Category 1 (Low Risk) involves patients with either LOPS or PAD, with recommended examinations every 6 to 12 months. Category 2 (Moderate Risk) covers patients with both LOPS and PAD, or one of these conditions plus a foot deformity, necessitating exams every 3 to 6 months. Finally, Category 3 (High Risk) includes individuals with LOPS or PAD accompanied by a history of foot ulcer, any amputation, or end-stage renal disease, with exams advised every 1 to 3 months. These stratified guidelines, based on expert opinion, are tailored to prevent severe complications like ulcers and amputations by providing a structured and intensive monitoring schedule for those at higher risk.",

        "content":"In Section 13 of the Clinical Diabetes Journal, the American Diabetes Association provides guidelines for managing diabetes in older adults. The medication management strategy recommends maintaining the current treatment regimen if the individual can perform necessary tasks, has infrequent acute illnesses, and has available support. However, it suggests deintensifying or simplifying the plan for those with severe or recurrent hypoglycemia, deteriorating health, cognitive or functional status, recent hospitalizations, wide glycemic excursions, significant social changes, or polypharmacy issues. Health goals vary based on the individual's condition: for healthy adults with minimal chronic illnesses and intact cognitive function, an A1C target of less than 7.0–7.5% (<53–58 mmol/mol) is advised; for those with multiple chronic illnesses or cognitive impairments, the target is less than 8.0% (<64 mmol/mol); in community-dwelling individuals receiving short-term rehabilitation, the focus is on glucose levels of 100–200 mg/dL (5.55–11.1 mmol/L) rather than A1C targets; and for those in very poor health or at the end of life, the aim is to avoid hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia. Additional considerations include the use of continuous glucose monitoring and medications to mitigate cardiorenal risks, and addressing cost-related treatment barriers. The document also details the simplification of complex insulin therapy: changing the timing from bedtime to morning, titrating basal insulin based on fasting glucose results with a goal of 90–150 mg/dL (5.0–8.3 mmol/L), and adjusting prandial insulin doses. If prandial insulin is over 10 units/dose, the dose should be reduced by 50% and a noninsulin agent added; if the dose is 10 units or less, it should be discontinued in favor of noninsulin agents. Noninsulin agents like metformin should be started at 500 mg daily if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is ≥45 mg/dL, with dose adjustments every two weeks. If eGFR is below 45 mg/dL or if metformin is not tolerated, a second-line agent should be used. Insulin doses should be adjusted based on pre-meal glucose readings, with increases if over 50% of values exceed the goal over two weeks, and decreases if more than two readings per week are below 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). The algorithm also recommends using 70% of the total insulin dose as basal insulin in the morning, and it includes tips such as avoiding rapid- and short-acting insulins at bedtime and using a simplified sliding scale for prandial insulin adjustments. These guidelines aim to ensure safe and effective diabetes management for older adults. For more details, the article Simplification of insulin regimen in older adults and risk of hypoglycemia by Munshi et al., published in JAMA Intern Med 2016, provides further context.

        "content":"In Section 5 of the Clinical Diabetes Journal, titled Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-Being to Improve Health Outcomes, the American Diabetes Association highlights the importance of building positive health behaviors and maintaining psychological well-being to achieve diabetes management goals and enhance quality of life. Essential tasks include referring patients for diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES), counseling on tobacco and vaping cessation, referring for medical nutrition therapy (MNT), counseling on health behaviors, and supporting psychosocial care through behavioral health professionals. These measures benefit all people with diabetes by ensuring informed decision-making, promoting self-care behaviors, facilitating problem-solving, improving collaboration with healthcare teams, imparting knowledge and self-care skills, and incorporating individual needs and experiences. Referrals should be made annually, at diagnosis, when treatment goals are unmet, when complicating factors develop, and during life transitions. Appropriate settings for these referrals include group or individual visits, and in-person, telehealth, or digital platforms. Essential components of these interventions include providing culturally appropriate content, being responsive to individual preferences, needs, and values, using positive, strength-based language that puts people first, and considering social determinants of health with a focus on health equity. Proven outcomes of DSMES include improved diabetes knowledge, self-care, and quality of life, lower A1C, self-reported weight reductions, reduced all-cause mortality risk, decreased acute care and hospital utilization, lower healthcare costs, increased use of primary care and preventive services, and positive coping behavior.Psychosocial care recommendations emphasize regular screening for mental health issues, including diabetes distress, and implementing collaborative, person-centered, and culturally informed interventions. Clinicians should screen people with diabetes, caregivers, and family members at least annually or when changes in disease, treatment, or life circumstances occur. Both clinical and subclinical psychological symptoms, which can affect self-management, glycemic stability, and mortality risk, should be addressed. Interventions should involve behavioral health professionals or other trained healthcare professionals with experience in diabetes and should consider individuals’ treatment burden, confidence, self-efficacy, and social and family support.Diabetes distress, linked to the ongoing demands of self-care and disease progression, significantly affects medication-taking behavior and is associated with higher A1C, lower self-efficacy, and less optimal eating and exercise habits. The document emphasizes that successful MNT programs are flexible, realistic, and sustainable, provided by registered dietitian nutritionists, and offered to all individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes mellitus. MNT programs should screen for disordered eating, food insecurity, and history of dieting. Key nutrition principles include incorporating nonstarchy vegetables, whole grains, nuts/seeds, low-fat dairy products, whole fruits, and legumes, while minimizing meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, refined grains, and ultra-processed foods. It is noted that no specific distribution of macronutrients is universally supported, allowing people with diabetes to choose from various healthy eating patterns that fit their needs and preferences.To support positive health behaviors, the document recommends motivational interviewing, patient activation, goal-setting and action-planning, problem-solving, encouragement of health behavior self-monitoring (with or without clinician feedback), and identification of social support resources. Additionally, it strongly advises against the use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes/vapes, and all tobacco products, recommending counseling and/or pharmacologic treatment to aid cessation.the American Diabetes Association emphasizes the importance of 24-hour physical behaviors for managing type 2 diabetes. Key behaviors include breaking up prolonged sitting, engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, stepping, and maintaining good sleep quality and quantity. The infographic details that breaking up prolonged sitting every 30 minutes with slow walking or simple resistance exercises can improve glucose metabolism. Engaging in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity spread over three days per week, supplemented with resistance, flexibility, and balance sessions, is recommended. Even 30 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity can improve metabolic profiles. Stepping, with an increase of 500 steps per day, is associated with a 2–9% decreased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality, and a 5–6 minute brisk walk per day equates to approximately four years' greater life expectancy.For sleep, aiming for consistent, uninterrupted sleep, even on weekends, is crucial. Both long (>8 hours) and short (<6 hours) sleep durations negatively impact A1C, while irregular sleep can lead to poorer glycemic levels due to conditions like insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome. Evening chronotypes (night owls) may have higher susceptibility to inactivity and poorer glycemic control compared to morning chronotypes (early birds).Strengthening exercises, which involve using one's own body weight or working against resistance, improve insulin sensitivity and glucose levels. Activities like tai chi and yoga also include elements of flexibility and balance. The impact of these physical behaviors on cardiometabolic health includes lower levels of glucose/insulin, blood pressure, A1C, lipids, and depression, and improvements in physical function and quality of life.",

Managing multiple risk factors simultaneously can prevent or slow the progression of ASCVD. Heart failure is another major cause of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease.Recommendations for the Treatment of Confirmed Hypertension in Nonpregnant People With Diabetes: For the treatment of confirmed hypertension in nonpregnant people with diabetes, initial BP ≥150/90 mmHg should be managed by starting two agents and assessing BP control and adverse effects. If targets are not met or adverse effects occur, start a drug from two of the following three options: ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), or thiazide-like diuretic, and reassess BP control and adverse effects. If still not meeting targets using drugs from each of the three classes, consider adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and refer to a specialist with expertise in BP management. For initial BP ≥130/80 mmHg and <150/90 mmHg, start one agent and assess BP control and adverse effects. If targets are not met or adverse effects occur, consider changing to an alternative medication from ACEi or ARB, CCB, or thiazide-like diuretic, and reassess BP control and adverse effects. If targets are still not met on two agents, consider adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and refer to a specialist. For individuals with albuminuria or coronary artery disease (CAD), start with ACEi or ARB and add CCB or thiazide-like diuretic if needed. Continue therapy and lifestyle management, assessing BP control and adverse effects. An ACEi or ARB is suggested for treating hypertension in people with CAD or a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 30–299 mg/g creatinine and is strongly recommended for individuals with UACR ≥300 mg/g creatinine. Dihydropyridine CCB and thiazide-like diuretics such as chlorthalidone and indapamide, which have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events, are preferred.Screening for Asymptomatic Cardiovascular Disease (CVD): For screening asymptomatic cardiovascular disease (CVD), individuals with diabetes who are aged 50 years or older, have any microvascular disease, foot complications, or end-stage organ damage from diabetes should be screened. It is also advisable to consider screening anyone with a diabetes duration of 10 years or more. For peripheral artery disease (PAD), all adults with diabetes should be screened, as diabetes increases the risks for both asymptomatic (stage B) and symptomatic (stage C) heart failure (HF). Routine screening for heart failure is not recommended for asymptomatic individuals. Screening for heart failure should include ankle-brachial index testing and measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP levels, with echocardiography recommended for those with abnormal BNP levels. If atypical cardiac symptoms, signs or symptoms of associated vascular disease, or electrocardiogram abnormalities are present, screening should be conducted using routine methods.Treatment of Stage B Heart Failure (HF) in People With Diabetes: For the treatment of Stage B Heart Failure (HF) in people with diabetes, to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization or progression to Stage C HF, it is recommended to use an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a β-blocker. If the individual is at high risk for or has established cardiovascular disease (CVD), consider using sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLTi) such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin. For those with diabetic kidney disease, finerenone or SGLT1/2 inhibitor (sotagliflozin) may be used.Lipid Management: How often should you check lipids? For people with prediabetes or diabetes not on lipid-lowering therapy, check lipids at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter. For those on lipid-lowering therapy, check lipids at initiation, 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose changes, and annually thereafter.Lipid Management for Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Events in People with Diabetes. For people aged 20–39 years, consider statin therapy if there are additional ASCVD risk factors. For people aged 40–75 years, use a moderate-intensity statin in those without ASCVD, and a high-intensity statin in those with ≥1 ASCVD risk factor, targeting an LDL cholesterol level of <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L). For people older than 75 years, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing the benefits and risks. It may also be reasonable to add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy, and use bempedoic acid for those who are statin intolerant.For lipid management for secondary prevention of ASCVD events in people with diabetes of all ages, high-intensity statin therapy should be used to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥50% from baseline to a target of <55 mg/dL (<1.4 mmol/L). If LDL cholesterol goals are not met on maximum tolerated statin therapy, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor. For those who are statin intolerant, alternative lipid-lowering treatments such as a PCSK9 inhibitor with monoclonal antibody treatment, bempedoic acid, or a PCSK9 inhibitor with siRNA inclisiran should be used. The statin therapy potency chart includes high-intensity statin therapy options like Atorvastatin (40–80 mg) and Rosuvastatin (20–40 mg), and moderate-intensity statin therapy options like Atorvastatin (10–20 mg), Rosuvastatin (5–10 mg), Simvastatin (20–40 mg), Pravastatin (40–80 mg), Lovastatin (40 mg), Fluvastatin XL (80 mg), and Pitavastatin (1–4 mg), all with once-daily dosing where XL indicates extended release.",
        "summary":"Section 10 of the Clinical Diabetes Journal discusses cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk management in diabetes, emphasizing the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF). ASCVD, including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease (PAD), is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes, with multiple risk factor management being crucial. For hypertension treatment in nonpregnant individuals with diabetes, initial BP ≥150/90 mmHg should be managed with two agents, and initial BP ≥130/80 mmHg with one agent, adjusting therapy based on BP control and adverse effects. An ACEi or ARB is recommended for those with albuminuria or CAD. Screening for asymptomatic CVD is recommended for individuals aged ≥50 years or with a diabetes duration ≥10 years, including tests for PAD, HF, and coronary artery disease using methods like ankle-brachial index testing and BNP measurements. For Stage B HF, treatment with an ACEi or ARB and a β-blocker is advised, with additional considerations for SGLT inhibitors in high-risk or established CVD cases and finerenone for diabetic kidney disease. Lipid management involves checking lipids at diagnosis and annually, or more frequently when on lipid-lowering therapy. For primary prevention of ASCVD in diabetes, moderate-intensity statins are recommended for those aged 40-75 without ASCVD, and high-intensity statins for those with ≥1 ASCVD risk factor, targeting LDL <70 mg/dL. For secondary prevention, high-intensity statins should reduce LDL by ≥50% to <55 mg/dL, with ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors added if goals are unmet. Statin-intolerant individuals should consider PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, or siRNA inclisiran. The statin potency chart lists high-intensity options like Atorvastatin (40–80 mg) and Rosuvastatin (20–40 mg), and moderate-intensity options like Atorvastatin (10–20 mg) and Rosuvastatin (5–10 mg), among others."

        "content":"In Section 14 of the ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes—2024 document titled Children and Adolescents, it is emphasized that children and adolescents with diabetes and their parents/caregivers should receive culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate individualized diabetes self-management education and support according to national standards at diagnosis and routinely thereafter. The recommendations for managing Type 1 diabetes are comprehensively addressed in this document. Regarding school and child care, it is noted that youth spend significant time in school/day care, necessitating personnel training for optimal diabetes care. Proper care ensures optimal diabetes management and safe access to all school- or day care–sponsored opportunities. Federal and state laws require schools, day care facilities, and other entities to provide the needed diabetes care to enable children to safely access the school or day care environment.For Type 2 Diabetes in Youth and Adolescents, the document outlines risk-based screening, which should be considered after the onset of puberty or at ≥10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier, in youth with overweight (BMI ≥85th percentile) or obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. Diagnosis can be made using fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and A1C. If a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is being considered, a panel of pancreatic autoantibodies should be tested to exclude the possibility of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Treatment for type 2 diabetes in youth may include metformin, insulin, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for use in youth with type 2 diabetes, and the sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin.Complications management involves regular monitoring and treatment as necessary: blood pressure should be measured at every clinic visit and treated if elevated on three separate measurements; urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate should be obtained at diagnosis and then annually; neuropathy screening by foot exam should be done at diagnosis and then annually; retinopathy screening by dilated fundoscopy should be done at diagnosis and then annually; evaluation for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (by measuring AST and ALT) should be done at diagnosis and then annually; screening for symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea should be done at each visit; evaluation for polycystic ovary syndrome in female adolescents when indicated; and lipid screening should be done after optimizing glycemia and then annually.In the ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes—2024 document, Addressing Probable New Cases of Type 2 Diabetes in Youth, the algorithm addresses the management of new-onset diabetes in youth with overweight or obesity who are clinically suspected of having type 2 diabetes. It begins with initiating lifestyle management and diabetes education for all patients. For those with an A1C <8.5% without acidosis or ketosis, treatment involves metformin, titrating up to 2,000 mg per day as tolerated. For A1C ≥8.5% without acidosis but potentially with ketosis, metformin is recommended, titrating up to 2,000 mg per day, and the addition of long-acting insulin starting at 0.5 units/kg/day and titrated every 2-3 days based on blood glucose monitoring (BGM). In cases with acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNK), management involves IV insulin until acidosis resolves, followed by subcutaneous insulin as for type 1 diabetes until pancreatic autoantibodies are known. If pancreatic autoantibodies are positive, the management approach aligns with type 1 diabetes, involving multiple daily injection insulin or pump therapy, and discontinuing metformin. If negative, continue or start metformin, titrate insulin based on glucose values, and if A1C goals are not met, consider adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT2 inhibitor approved for youth with type 2 diabetes, and initiate or titrate insulin therapy as needed. The flowchart emphasizes the differentiation between type 1 and type 2 diabetes and provides a structured approach to medication initiation and adjustment based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings. The footnote references the adapted management guidelines from Arslanian et al., highlighting the importance of appropriate intervention strategies in youth-onset type 2 diabetes to prevent complications and optimize glycemic control.The suggested citation for these guidelines is: American Diabetes Association Primary Care Advisory Group. 14.

A holistic approach to improving outcomes in people with diabetes and CKD includes lifestyle interventions such as a healthy diet, physical activity, smoking cessation, and weight management. First-line drug therapy involves SGLT2 inhibitors (initiated if eGFR ≥20; continue until dialysis or transplant), metformin (if eGFR ≥30), and RAS inhibitors at the maximum tolerated dose if hypertension is present. Regular reassessment of glycemia, albuminuria, BP, cardiovascular disease risk, and lipids is essential. Additional risk-based therapy includes GLP-1 receptor agonists if needed to achieve individualized glycemic targets, nonsteroidal MRAs if ACR ≥30 mg/g and normal potassium, and dihydropyridine CCB and/or diuretics if needed to achieve individualized BP targets. For clinical ASCVD, antiplatelet agents may be indicated based on ASCVD risk and lipids, and ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or icosapent ethyl should be considered if indicated. Regular risk factor reassessment is recommended every 3–6 months. Clinical tips include periodically checking serum creatinine and potassium levels when ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal MRAs are used, not discontinuing ACE inhibitors or ARBs for increases ≤30% in serum creatinine in the absence of volume depletion, and aiming for a urinary albumin reduction of ≥30% in people with CKD and urinary albumin ≥300 mg/g to slow CKD progression.
